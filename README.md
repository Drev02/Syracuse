Test of the syracuse problem on different number (3n+1 algorithm)

syracuse.java : 
--------------
Explanation : give a number 
if even : divide by 2
if odd : 3 * n + 1
and do it until it reach 4-2-1 loop.

Syracuse : set how many numbers we test (100 000 in the program)
and for each of them give how many operations until we reach 1.

It gives at the end the best number, with the most of operations.

syraManual.java : 
---------------
give a unique number by the user and return the details of all operations done until we reach one.
